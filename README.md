# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict diabetes based on medical data. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains medical measurements and a diabetes diagnosis label.

Dataset Details

The dataset consists of 768 samples with 8 features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that estimates diabetes risk based on family history

Age: Age in years

Outcome: 0 (No Diabetes), 1 (Diabetes)

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Model)

Jupyter Notebook


Model Performance

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Accuracy: ~74%

Precision & Recall: Model performs well in detecting non-diabetic cases but needs improvement for diabetic cases.

Future Improvements

Try different ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost)

Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy

Use feature engineering to improve model performance
